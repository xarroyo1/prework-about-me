      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer so I can apply these skills to other aspects of my life.
        I want to create my own website for my own practice when I become a Psychologist and I would also like to apply these 
        skills to create a website for an Environmental awareness non-profit organization I hope to create in the future. Also, 
        being a web developer seems difficult, but it has always been an interest of mine and I hope to become a master at it in no time.
